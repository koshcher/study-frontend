    <h1>Michelangelo</h1>
    <p>
      Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), known simply as Michelangelo, was an
      Italian sculptor, painter, architect and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work
      had a major influence on the development of Western art, particularly in relation to the Renaissance notions of
      humanism and naturalism. He is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along
      with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence,
      sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century and several
      scholars have described Michelangelo as the most accomplished artist of his era.<br>
      He sculpted two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, before the age of thirty. Despite holding a low
      opinion of painting, he also created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the
      scenes
      from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of
      the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture. At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the
      Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. He transformed the plan so that the western end was finished to
      his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.<br>
      Michelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive. In fact, two
      biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that Michelangelo's work
      transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was "supreme in not one art alone but in all three."<br>
      In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino ("the divine one"). His contemporaries often admired his
      terribilità—his ability to instill a sense of awe in viewers of his art. Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate
      Michelangelo's impassioned, highly personal style contributed to the rise of Mannerism, a short-lived style and
      period in Western art following the High Renaissance.<br>
