				I am in 10th form. I finished all forms with excellent marks. I is wanted by my parants. In past I learnt some python and django a bit by myself. After entering STEP academy I switched to C++. I like C++ and wrote my first full project using it. Next I learned C# and now using it like my main language. WPF is cool but I bet on MAUI. By myself learn ASP.NET Core and working on aklhub.
